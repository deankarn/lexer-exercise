# lexer-exercise
JSON lexer meetup exercise


## Goals
Create a JSON lexer
 
## Parser Phase
Create a parser which can lookup and return:
- A single key and return it's value.
- A single key and return multiple values, from an array of objects.

Requirements
------------
- Handles all JSON types and punctuations (except whitespace because it's unimportant!)
- Handles unicode, not just ASCII
- Handles nested keys

Bonus/Hints
-----
- Good lexers don't generally handle errors.
